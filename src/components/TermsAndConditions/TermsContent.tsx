        </p>
        <p>
          If you are hosting a Contest on the platform, you shall have access to
          all users who enter you contest.
        </p>
        <h3>Contests</h3>
        <p>
          Buyers can promote a Contest hosted on the platform by providing a
          Contest rules and regulations and paying any relevant fees in
          accordance to our instructions provided on the platform. Relevant fees
          may include an administration fee and also a commission on the income
          generated by the Contest. A Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it is
          solely responsible for the operation and promotion of the Contest and
          warrants that it will comply with all applicable law in respect of the
          operation and promotion of the Contest. We have no liability for loss
          suffered by a user in connection with a Contest including but not
          limited to loss suffered (or penalties imposed) in connection with any
          contravention of law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entrants may submit their entries in an appropriate format as
          specified on the Platform. All entries must comply with the Contest
          rules and regulations and must not infringe any Intellectual Property
          Rights. Any entry which infringes any Intellectual Property Rights
          will be an ineligible entry and subject to removal either by the Buyer
          or us and subject to action as per our IP Infringement Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buyers can promote either: (1) a regular prepaid Contest, under which
          a Buyer may select one or more winning Entrant(s) and Buyers may
          request that the Contest Prize be released to them if a winner has not
          been chosen within 30 days of the Contest closing date; or (2) a
          guaranteed Contest, under which a Buyer may select one or more winning
          Seller(s) and if no winner is selected, we will release the Contest
          Prize to Entrants of the guaranteed Contest and charge the appropriate
          fees and the Buyer will have no rights to have the Contest Prize
          released to them or to use any entries that have been submitted. After
          30 days of the Contest closing date, we reserve the right to
          distribute the Contest prize to the participating Sellers.
        </p>
        <p>
          After awarding a Contest Prize, the Buyer and winning Entrant(s) will
          enter into a handover and when the winning Entrant(s) has uploaded the
          winning entry (including all related files) to the Buyer, the Contest
          Prize will be released to the winner of the Contest unless disputed by
          the Buyer in which case the dispute must be resolved between the Buyer
          and winning Entrant(s) before we can release the Contest Prize to the
          winning Entrant(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          For avoidance of doubt, the Buyer has no right or licence to use any
          entries other than the winning entry/entries. The Buyer may not: (1)
          promote a Contest via the platform if the Buyer is hosting a similar
          Contest through another service; (2) allow or request Sellers to
          submit entries to the Buyer via other means than the platform; and (3)
          award another Account that might be deemed as collusion or awarding
          another Account owned by the Buyer.
